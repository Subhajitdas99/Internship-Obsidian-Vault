# Product Vision

## The Problem

Enterprise legacy systems contain **85% of business logic in code** - not in documentation, not in people's heads. When organizations need to modernize these systems, they face a fundamental challenge: **understanding what the code actually does**.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         THE LEGACY PARADOX                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                          │
│  Legacy systems are simultaneously:                                      │
│                                                                          │
│  ✓ The most VALUABLE software (proven, running, making money)           │
│  ✓ The most DIFFICULT software (hard to understand, change, test)       │
│  ✓ The most RISKY software (change one thing, break something else)     │
│                                                                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Current AI coding tools (Copilot, Cursor) are optimized for **writing new code**, not for **understanding existing enterprise systems**. They lack:

- Business context awareness
- Domain-specific understanding
- Workflow and process tracing
- Runtime behavior correlation

## The Opportunity

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Legacy modernization market | $300B+ annually | McKinsey |
| Fortune 500 software 20+ years old | 70% | McKinsey 2024 |
| CIOs citing legacy as barrier | 60% | Gartner |
| Technology estate as technical debt | 20-40% | Salfati Group 2025 |
| Timeline reduction with AI | 40-50% | Industry average |

---

## Our Solution

**A code intelligence platform that helps AI assistants understand enterprise legacy codebases for modernization.**

We build tools that:

1. **Index** legacy codebases using multiple extraction modes
2. **Extract** business rules, workflows, and relationships
3. **Provide** structured context to AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor)
4. **Improve** AI responses about legacy systems - measurably

---

## Target Users

### Primary: Developers on Modernization Teams

- Need to understand unfamiliar legacy code
- Must preserve business behavior during migration
- Work under time pressure with incomplete documentation

### Secondary: AI Assistants

- Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot
- Need structured context about enterprise codebases
- Currently lack business domain understanding

---

## Success Criteria

The platform succeeds when:

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Context Quality | AI answers improve by 20%+ | Before/after comparison |
| Business Rule Extraction | 80%+ accuracy | Manual verification |
| Workflow Coverage | 90%+ of entry points traced | Coverage analysis |
| Developer Time Saved | 40%+ reduction | Time to understand code |

---

## What We Are NOT Building

- A replacement for Cursor/Copilot (we augment them)
- A migration automation tool (we provide understanding)
- A general-purpose code search (we focus on enterprise modernization)
