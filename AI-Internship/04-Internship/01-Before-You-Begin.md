# Before You Begin

## The Reality of This Internship

We're a **small organization** with limited time and resources. We offered this internship **without any fee** because we believe in sharing knowledge and growing the next generation of engineers. But we need you to understand something important:

**Think of this like being dropped in the Amazon rainforest.**

You have:
- A compass (this documentation)
- Some basic tools (the target codebases, concepts explained here)
- Radio contact to base camp (our mentors — but we can only respond so often)

You don't have:
- A guide holding your hand through every step
- Someone doing the work for you
- Unlimited mentor time

## What This Means for You

### We Understand

- **You're new to your career** — this might be your first real technical challenge
- **Remote work is hard** — no one sitting next to you to ask questions
- **The topics are complex** — DDD, AST parsing, embeddings are not simple
- **You're passionate** — you wouldn't be here otherwise

### We Commit To

- **Sharing our knowledge** even during busy schedules
- **Reviewing your work** and giving feedback
- **Answering questions** when you're truly stuck (not when you haven't tried)

### We Expect You To

- **Research first, ask second** — Google it, read the docs, try things
- **Show initiative** — don't wait for instructions, figure it out
- **Document your struggles** — "I tried X, Y, Z and still stuck" is a valid question
- **Produce tangible results** — something working, not just "I read the docs"

## The "Rainforest Test"

Your performance this week determines whether we continue together. We have limited mentorship capacity — we invest it in people who demonstrate they can:

1. **Survive with limited guidance** — figure things out when the path isn't clear
2. **Learn independently** — we can't teach everything, you must pull knowledge
3. **Deliver results** — talk is cheap, show us what you built

This is not about being harsh. It's about being honest about our constraints and your opportunity.

## How to Ask Good Questions

When you're stuck, don't just say "I'm stuck" or "It doesn't work."

**Bad question:**
> "How do I extract entities from ERPNext?"

**Good question:**
> "I'm trying to extract entities from ERPNext. I read the DocType documentation and found the JSON files in `erpnext/accounts/doctype/`. I wrote a script that parses the JSON but I'm getting empty results for the 'fields' key. Here's my code: [code]. What am I missing?"

The difference:
- Shows you tried
- Shows what you learned
- Shows specific blockers
- Respects our time

## Your Opportunity

If you pass this week:
- You get **3 more weeks** of guided learning
- You work on **real modernization problems**
- You build **portfolio-worthy projects**
- You get **references** for future opportunities

If you demonstrate exceptional initiative:
- Extended internship opportunities
- Potential project collaboration
- Direct mentorship on advanced topics
