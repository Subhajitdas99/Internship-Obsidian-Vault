|---------|--------------|
| **Private repo** | Check settings → Public |
| **No instructions** | Test README on a fresh clone |
| **Hardcoded paths** | Use relative paths or config |
| **No output** | Verify tool produces files |
| **Silent failures** | Add error messages |
| **Too long video** | Edit to 10 min max |
| **No audio** | Test before recording |
