# Day 14 – Final Polish & Reflection

## What I Completed
- Finalized call graph, import graph, and cycle detection
- Added Mermaid visualizations with cycle highlighting
- Cleaned repository for portfolio readiness
- Documented architecture and limitations

## Key Learnings
- ASTs provide semantic understanding beyond text
- Graph-based representations are critical for AI reasoning
- Cyclic dependencies are detectable via static analysis
- Tooling quality matters as much as algorithms

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Static analysis fundamentals
- Graph construction and traversal
- Engineering discipline (clean commits, docs, structure)
- Readiness for AI tooling and platform roles

## Next Directions (If Continued)
- Severity scoring for cycles
- Graph embeddings for retrieval
- CI integration for architectural checks
