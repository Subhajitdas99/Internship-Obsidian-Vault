🧠 Mini Code Analyzer

AST-based Static Code Intelligence Tool (Python)

A minimal yet powerful static analysis engine built using Python’s ast module to understand code structure, dependencies, and execution flow — without running the code.

This project focuses on learning how real code intelligence tools work internally.

🚀 Why This Project Exists

Modern AI systems (GraphRAG, Copilot-style tools, refactoring engines) cannot rely on raw text alone.
They need structured understanding of code:

Which functions call which?

How modules depend on each other?

Where are architectural risks like cyclic dependencies?

This project answers those questions using pure static analysis.

✨ Key Capabilities
1️⃣ Call Graph Extraction

Detects:

Functions

Class methods

Cross-module calls

Outputs a fully qualified call graph:

module.Class.method → module.function

2️⃣ Import Dependency Graph

Tracks import and from … import …

Builds a module dependency graph

Differentiates internal vs external structure

3️⃣ Multi-File Analysis

Analyze:

Single Python file

Entire directory (recursively)

Merges results into one global graph

4️⃣ Cycle Detection (Architecture Risk)

Detects cyclic dependencies using DFS

Outputs:

Human-readable cycles

Machine-readable cycles.json

Example:

a.func_a → b.func_b → c.func_c → a.func_a

5️⃣ Visual Graph Export (Mermaid)

Generates:

call_graph.mmd

import_graph.mmd

Features:

Module grouping

Red-highlighted cycle edges

Cycle labels

These diagrams render cleanly in:

Mermaid Live

GitHub

Documentation systems

▶️ How to Run
Step 1: Analyze Code
python analyzer.py examples/multi_file_project


Generates:

call_graph.json

Step 2: Detect Cycles
python cycle_detector.py


Output:

Console cycle report

cycles.json

Step 3: Generate Diagrams
python graph_exporter.py


Creates:

diagrams/call_graph.mmd

diagrams/import_graph.mmd

🧪 Example Output
Call Graph (JSON)
{
  "a.func_a": ["b.func_b"],
  "b.func_b": ["c.func_c"],
  "c.func_c": ["a.func_a"]
}

Import Graph
{
  "a": ["b"],
  "b": ["c"],
  "c": ["a"]
}

🧠 How This Fits AI / GraphRAG Systems

This analyzer provides structured, machine-readable code context that can be fed into:

GraphRAG pipelines

LLM code assistants

Refactoring tools

Legacy modernization systems

Instead of raw text, an LLM receives:

Execution paths

Dependency boundaries

Risk hotspots (cycles)

This drastically improves reasoning quality.

⚠️ Known Limitations (By Design)

No runtime resolution (static only)

No dynamic dispatch inference

No type inference yet

These are intentional to keep the learning surface focused.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Severity ranking of cycles

Cross-repo analysis

Graph embeddings for LLM retrieval

CI integration for architecture checks

🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

Deep understanding of Python AST

Graph theory applied to real systems

Static analysis fundamentals

Tooling mindset (not just scripts)

Readiness for AI / platform engineering work

## 🔁 Cyclic Dependency Example

The analyzer can detect and visualize cyclic dependencies, which are common
architectural risks in large codebases.

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph a
    "a.func_a"
  end
  subgraph b
    "b.func_b"
  end
  subgraph c
    "c.func_c"
  end

  "a.func_a" -->|cycle| "b.func_b":::cycleEdge
  "b.func_b" -->|cycle| "c.func_c":::cycleEdge
  "c.func_c" -->|cycle| "a.func_a":::cycleEdge

  classDef cycleEdge stroke:red,stroke-width:3px;

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

This tool follows a clear static analysis pipeline:

1. Parse Python files into ASTs
2. Extract call relationships and imports
3. Merge results across multiple files
4. Detect architectural risks (cycles)
5. Export graphs for visualization and AI consumption

Each stage produces structured, machine-readable output.


## 🚫 What This Tool Is Not

- Not a runtime tracer
- Not a type inference engine
- Not framework-aware (Django, FastAPI, etc.)

These are deliberate tradeoffs to focus on static code intelligence fundamentals.
